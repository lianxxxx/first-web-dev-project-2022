# First Web Development Project (2022)

This is my very first web development project, created in 2022 using HTML and CSS.  
No AI was used—just Stack Overflow, trial-and-error, and lots of learning.  
Design and layout created entirely by me.

## About

- **Notes:** Not responsive, some images may not load  
- **Purpose:** Demonstrates how I started learning web development.
